### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- **rldorado/rldorado** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm a **Front-End Engineer**, passionate about Design, UI & UX because of my Game Developer background. I love to be on lastest technologies of JavaScript or TypeScript environments and use clean and self-explanatory code to make everyone lifes easier.

Currently I'm very focused on [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) library as I find it very easy to understand and powerful at same time. I'm also trying to get closer to mobile world and learn [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) with typed code as **TypeScript** and **Styled components**.
